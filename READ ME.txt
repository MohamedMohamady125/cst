Project Description

This project implements the classical fourth-order Runge Kutta (RK4) method to solve the ordinary differential equation:

y' = y / (e^x − 1), with y(1) = 5.

The program was developed in Python using PyCharm and produces results for both a short run (5 RK4 steps) and a long run (about 1500 steps). A comparison with Euler’s method is also included.

Files Included

Project2_Report.docx: Full project documentation including introduction, mathematical method, implementation, results, and conclusion.

ODE.py: Python source code that implements the RK4 algorithm and runs both short and long experiments.

README.md: Instructions for running the code and list of deliverables.

How to Run

Open ODE.py in PyCharm

Set the short_run flag to True for the 5-step demonstration, or False for the long run.

Run the program.

Output will display in the console.

Notes

The manual RK4 table for the first 5 steps is included in the report.

The program output (console screenshots) is also shown in the Results section of the report.
